        Your presence is present enough. We don't want gifts, we'd rather you contribute to the celebration - bring your special talents (musicians/dance teachers/photographers especially welcome) and for the Sydney/Brisbane celebrations, some food and drink to share (Melbourne will be catered). We're intentionally keeping the budget for the wedding very small because <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/heart-the-matter/201604/when-it-comes-weddings-does-cost-really-matter">research indicates that the more you spend, the less happy your marriage is</a>. Therefore, please don't feel like you need to contribute financially for the cost of the wedding. If you really want to get us something, please donate to one of the effective charities <a href="https://effectivealtruism.org.au/partner-charities/">listed here</a>.

        <p class="thin">Sandy and Jeremy met on the dating website eHarmony. After several weeks of answering quizzes, the robot matchmaker finally allowed them to exchange messages and they agreed to meet in person for a coastal walk from Spit Bridge to Manly. It just so happened that the only day that worked for them was February 14th. The auspicious date and the 3hr long walk meant they were both emotionally invested in the first meeting. Sandy claims Jeremy "looked like an alien" but still decided to go on a second date with him.<br /><br />Five dates later, having assessed Sandy's romantic suitability and physical fitness through a series of active dates involving bicycling, running, swimming, triathlon and rock climbing, Jeremy had collected enough data to populate his comparison spreadsheet (see the <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/hannah_fry_the_mathematics_of_love">TED talk "Mathematics of love"</a>) which he used to compare several women he was dating along with his ex-girlfriends. Sandy got the highest score ever: 98.1% and beat out the competition to claim Jeremy's heart. Strangely for an accountant, Sandy had not completed a similar spreadsheet but nonetheless decided that Jeremy met her criteria.

        <p class="thin">A few months into their relationship, the two went to see Alain de Botton talk about his book, "A course on love". The philosopher quipped that when the honeymoon period ends, each party in a couple discovers that the other person is very hard to live with and that the strength of a relationship relies on tolerating this fact. Eager to test this concept, Jeremy moved in with Sandy six months into their relationship. They soon discovered that Mr de Botton was right: both of them are hard to live with. Jeremy's predeliction for keeping one month worth of tinned food, batteries and water in case there is a flood/zombie invasion annoyed Sandy. Sandy's insistence that her 12 pairs of shoes were not enough and that she absolutely needed a new pair even though the cupboard was full of shoes that he had never seen her wear confounded Jeremy.
          <br/></br>
          Nonetheless, they have learnt to accept each other's foibles and have decided that even though the other person is impossible to live with, it would be impossible to live without them.
          <br /></br>
          During their time together, Sandy and Jeremy have enjoyed many adventures:
          <ul>
            <li>Scuba diving with turtles on the Great Barrier Reef</li>
            <li>Cross country skiing next to mountain cats in the chilly (-30 degree) plains of Changchun, China</li>
            <li>Eating fried silk worms</li>
            <li>Meeting >100 of Sandy's relatives in Guangzhou, China during Chinese New Year</li>
            <li>Meeting >30 of Jeremy's relatives for Christmas</li>
            <li>Volunteering at SES to help out during storms</li>
            <li>Building Sandy's startup, <a href="greenrenter.com.au">GreenRenter</a></li>
            <li>Attending protests together</li>

        <h3>The Proposal</h3>
        <p class="thin">As you might have noticed, Jeremy likes to make evidence based decisions. Upon reading an article in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/10/the-divorce-proof-marriage/381401/">The Atlantic</a>, which states that couples who date for three years prior to getting engaged have a 39% lower chance of getting divorced, Jeremy decided to make the third "dateaversary" the day to propose. Conveniently this coincided with Valentines Day. The proposal involved a game of mini golf (which Jeremy won hence the trick question in the quiz ðŸ˜‰) followed by a stroll through Victoria Park in Marrickville.</br>
          </br>
          After several suitability vague questions ("Would you like to be Mateo's (Jeremy's brother's new baby) aunty?") to avoid embarrassing himself, Jeremy suggested that they do some lunges to limber up their legs. While on one knee, he popped the question. Sandy said yes but on one condition: Jeremy had to do the dishes when they got home. He agreed to this counter-offer.
